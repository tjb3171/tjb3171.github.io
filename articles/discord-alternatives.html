    <h1>A list of Discord Alternatives for non-super-nerdy people</h1>

    <p>
      Discord has announced that soon, all users <u>in any country</u> will have to verify their age using government ID or selfies.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they claim that your data is quickly deleted, k-ID's privacy policy on this is very vague and they may send that data to even more 3rd parties, making it subject to their policies too. How quickly they delete it also isn't very clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      A recent Discord data breach leaked at least 70,000 people's IDs because another 3rd party didn't handle data properly, which really helps us trust them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't comply, you can't:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Access channels and servers set as NSFW (why are you using Discord for that anyway)
      </li>
      <li>
        Disable some safety settings (which are annoying but I can live with them)</li>
      <li>
        Speak on stages (you can just use normal voice chats, with some downsides)
      </li>

    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the precedent this sets (for worldwide age verification regardless of if your country's laws require it or not) <u>will lead to more companies locking more things behind risking being doxxed in the future</u>.

      <li><h2>Stoat (formerly known as Revolt)</h2></li>
      <div class="tldr">
        Simple to use: 10/10. Customisable: 8/10. Does everything you need: 7/10. Has Bots. Moderation: 9/10. Web, Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, iPadOS, Andriod. Overall: 6/10
      </div>
      <p>Stoat is very simple and is basically the same as Discord. Development on it is kinda slow and it lacks some features, with things like screenshare being a "coming soon". However it's super staightforward and easy to use.</p>
      <p>It's also quite different from Discord and might take some getting used to, but it gets the job done pretty well.</p>
      <p>If you want to use it, the <a href="https://stoat.chat/download">download is here</a>.</p>

      <li><h2>Matrix (using the default server and Element client)</h2></li>
      <div class="tldr">
        Simple to use: 7/10. Customisable: 10/10. Does everything you need: 7/10. Has Bots. Moderation: 6/10 (<a href="https://matrix.org/docs/communities/moderation/">use a bot for this</a>). Web, Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Andriod. <u>Technical knowledge required if running a very large community.</u> Overall: 7/10
      </div>

      <p>Matrix has a reputation for being confusing as heck, probably because a lot of youtubers are bad at explaining it, but I personally found it quite simple. You can do all sorts of crazy stuff and self-host and other confusing things, but you don't have to do any of that to use it as a messaging app.</p>

      <p>Matrix can be used with lots of different clients, each with different features, and you can self-host but you can also join a pre-existing server and use it like normal.</p>

      <p>It's also quite different from Discord and might take some getting used to, but it gets the job done pretty well. Keep in mind that while it's good for small group chats, moderation for bigger group chats and communities can get annoying.</p>
      <p>The element client is the most straightforward and easy-to-use one, you can <a href="https://element.io/en/download">download it here</a>.</p>

      <br>
      <br>
      
      <li><h2>Fluxer</h2></li>

      <div class="tldr">
        Simple to use: 9/10. Customisable: 8/10. Does everything you need: 9/10. Bots are not implemented yet. Moderation: 10/10. Web (works on Mobile), Windows, MacOS, Linux. Native mobile apps are WIP. In Beta; potentially slightly unstable.  Overall: 9/10
      </div>
      <p>Basically the same as Discord; the UI is very similar and everything works pretty much the same. Some features missing, such as Discovery, but this is planned to be added soon.</p>
      <p><u>While in Beta, they manually review every registration which takes time</u> so it takes a few days to create an account.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://fluxer.app/download">download is here</a> and the <a href="https://web.fluxer.app/channels/@me">Web-App is here</a>.</p>

      <li><h2>RootApp</h2></li>
      <div class="tldr">
        Simple to use: 9/10. Customisable: 6/10. Does everything you need: 9/10. Apps & Bots coming soon. Moderation: 9/10. Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Andriod. In Beta; a bit buggy. <u>Can Import server templates from Discord.</u> Overall: 8/10
      </div>
      <p>Does more or less everything a normal discord server should do. Also, in the future you will be able to use apps/bots to make it super customisable. (not implemented yet)</p>
      <p>Their privacy policy is a bit vague and apparently they might collect a lot of data about you, although apparently there are plans to rewrite it to be less vauge (and hopefully less intrusive) in the future. So if you care about that sort of thing, check the latest news to see what their privacy policy currently says.</p>
